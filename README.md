# Hello-World
First Git(intro)

Hello everybody,
This is Tanmay and I'm a junior at Liberty High school, Frisco, TX. I really like badminton and play the guitar in my free time. I'm also passionate about robotics and programming and part of the FRC team Radicubs Robotics. Alright thats all I can think of. Peace out!
